1- Determine MVP-1
    Ask the question: What is the essentials, what must the project have in order to be viable/valuable
    Put together a wish-list of other features that would be great for MVP-2 etc…

2- Requirements
    What are the functionality requirements

3- User stories
    highlight nouns as potential classes
    highlight verbs as potential functions/behaviors
    discard duplicate find and eliminate redundancies DRY

4- Create class diagram
    After selecting classes/objects
    UML Diagram
    Or just diagram anything in a way that makes sense to you.
        How do your objects interact, what functions do they need?

5- Decide/Listing technologies
    Let form follow function
        i.e. Do you need to persist data? You need a database etc.
        Also, are you interested in highlighting or building skill in a certain framework etc.

6- Build small starting ONLY w/MVP-1 (the essentials)
    Test often…
    When writing unit tests, consider the feature tests you’re already doing. Those are things you can automate into unit tests
